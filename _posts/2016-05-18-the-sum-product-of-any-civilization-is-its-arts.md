**The sum product of any Civilization is its Arts.**

> I read a statement today that said "The sum product of any civilization is its arts." I would have to agree. But I would also say that The Arts also show you where society is going. The Arts can show the soul impulse to change and to growth, and/or the current societies inclination to destruction. (Maybe its 2 sides of the same coin.) The Arts, and this would also include the new thought scientists, are the ones that bring in the new ideas and expose the outdated beliefs. If you look at the visionary artists of today such as [Alex Grey][0], you get a peek at the evolutionary change we are all headed for. Or check out the visionary landscapes and art of [Daniel B. Holeman][1]. 

Every prophecy out there points to something big happening now. I'll bet you can feel it in your body. If it's true that we really create our reality, then lets create the most incredible conscious jump into our evolution that this universe has ever witnessed. For many reasons we have been kept from the knowledge of how to do this. But it is written in our very DNA. That's why all the teachers are saying look within.

After we look within we are compelled to share what we find with others as this is the natural outcome of discovering our oneness. One way I do this is through my Art. When you find the great love that is who we all are, there is nothing left to do but love each other, and then watch how fast the world starts reflecting that oneness. The cycle that is ending is the belief in separation. And the less we judge it as it goes, the more inspired and creative our solutions become.
